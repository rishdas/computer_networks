####HTTP Web Server, Client and UDP variant of both#####
-----Stark Server and Lannister client---


$tar xvf stark_package.tar
$cd stark_package
----Build Server----

$cd lib
$make
$cd ..
$make
$export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Run the server--
$./web_server.bin 20010 -- in case silo please choose a port higher than 20000

Note: After closing the server if you want to monitor logs a log file with extension .log will be genrated.

----Build Client----
$cd $ROOT -- as in the root of untared directory
$cd client
$make
$./web_client.bin silo.soic.indiana.edu 20010 np FileListCaps.txt
Syntax--
$/web_client.bin <hostname> <server_port> <np/p:Connection type> <Requesting File>

Note: If the requesting file is in the wd of the client then it assumes that its a list of files in Server. I have left 2 such files FileListCaps.txt and FileList.txt. If the file is not present in your PWD then it will try to fetch it from the server(just that file only).

Note: After closing the server if you want to monitor logs a log file with extension .log will be genrated.


---Build UDP server---
cd $ROOT -- as in the root of untared directory
$cd udp_server
$make
$./udp_server 20010  -- same logic of port nos as mentioned above

Note: After closing the server if you want to monitor logs a log file with extension .log will be genrated.

---Build UDP client---

$cd $ROOT -- as in the root of untared directory
$cd udp_server/client
$make
$./udp_client.bin silo.soic.indiana.edu 20010 HelloWorld.html
$./udp_client.bin localhost 20010 FileListCaps.txt

Note: In case of silo run server and client on same machine cause it is not able to connect to the silo machine via UDP maybe becuase of firewall issues.

Note: If the requesting file is in the wd of the client then it assumes that its a list of files in Server. I have left 2 such files FileListCaps.txt and FileList.txt. If the file is not present in your PWD then it will try to fetch it from the server(just that file only).

Note: After closing the server if you want to monitor logs a log file with extension .log will be genrated.
